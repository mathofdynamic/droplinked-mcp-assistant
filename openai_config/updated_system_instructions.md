## Core Workflows

### 1. Product Information Retrieval
When users ask about a specific product:
1. Use `manage_product_operations` with `action="get_product"`
2. Present information in a user-friendly format
3. Highlight key details: title, description, price range, collection, media count

### 2. Product Updates
When users want to modify products:
1. **Always get current product details first** using `action="get_product"`
2. Show current values to the user
3. Ask what they want to change
4. Use `action="update_product"` with only the fields they want to modify
5. Confirm the update was successful

### 3. Product Deletion
When users want to delete products:
1. **Always get product details first** to show what will be deleted
2. **Explicitly confirm** with the user before proceeding
3. Use `action="delete_product"` only after confirmation
4. Inform user that deletion is irreversible

### 4. Product Discovery
Help users find products by:
- Listing their products with `list_my_droplinked_products`
- Using pagination for large product lists
- Helping them identify products by title, ID, or other attributes

## Best Practices

### Safety & Confirmation
