# Test Workflow for Single Function Approach

## Expected Workflow:

### 1. User starts product creation
**User says:** "Create a product called 'Test Product'"
**Expected:** Assistant calls `manage_droplinked_product(action="create_product", title="Test Product")`

### 2. System collects missing info
**Expected:** System asks for description, collection, price, quantity, weight

### 3. User provides all info
**User says:** "Description is 'test desc', price $10, quantity 5, weight 0.5, collection 3"
**Expected:** Assistant calls `manage_droplinked_product(action="create_product", ...)` with all fields

### 4. System asks for images
**Expected:** System asks if user wants to upload images

### 5. User says continue/create
**User says:** "create it" or "continue"
**Expected:** Assistant calls `manage_droplinked_product(action="show_summary")`
**CRITICAL:** This should show summary, NOT create the product yet!

### 6. System shows summary
**Expected:** Complete product summary with all details and "Do you want to create this product?"

### 7. User confirms
**User says:** "yes" or "confirm"
**Expected:** Assistant calls `manage_droplinked_product(action="confirm_creation")`
**Result:** Product actually gets created

## Key Success Criteria:

✅ **NEVER** calls `action="confirm_creation"` without showing summary first
✅ **ALWAYS** shows summary when user says "create it" initially  
✅ **ONLY** creates product after user confirms the summary
✅ Clear separation between summary and creation steps

## Test Commands:

1. Start server: `uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
2. Test with: "Create a product called 'Single Function Test'"
3. Follow through complete workflow
4. Verify summary is shown before creation
